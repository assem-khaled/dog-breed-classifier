# Dog Breed Classifier in PyTorch
This project is a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, the goal is to develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, that can classifiy dog breeds
and distinguish between dogs, human faces and other objects.

## Transfer Learning
Used Resnet50 for transfer learning and achieved accuracy up to 82% after only 10 epochs.
